# ML-Project
# Airbnb Price Prediction and Insights

* Built an **end-to-end Airbnb price prediction system** using machine learning and extensive exploratory data analysis
* Analyzed a large-scale dataset with **74,000+ listings and 29+ features** to identify pricing trends and patterns
* Performed **data cleaning and preprocessing**, including missing value imputation, duplicate removal and outlier treatment using Z-score analysis
* Conducted in-depth **EDA with visualizations** to understand room types, property types, correlations and outliers
* Engineered advanced features such as **neighbourhood popularity, amenities count, host experience and booking frequency metrics**
* Encoded categorical variables and applied **feature scaling** to prepare data for model training
* Trained and compared **Linear Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest and SVM** regression models
* Applied **GridSearchCV** for hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance
* **Random Forest** emerged as the best model with an **R² score of ~0.67 and low RMSE**, indicating a moderate and reliable fit
* Evaluated model performance using **RMSE, MAE, R², feature importance analysis and residual distribution visualizations**

# **Customer Churn Prediction and Retention Insights**

* Built an **end-to-end customer churn prediction system** using supervised machine learning
* Analyzed a telecom dataset with **7,043 customers and 20 features** to identify churn patterns
* Performed **data cleaning and preprocessing**, including missing value imputation and duplicate checks
* Conducted in-depth **EDA with visualizations** such as correlation heatmaps, boxplots and distribution charts
* Encoded categorical variables using **Label Encoding** and applied **StandardScaler** for feature scaling
* Addressed **class imbalance** using the `class_weight='balanced'` parameter
* Trained and compared **Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest and SVM** classification models
* Applied **GridSearchCV** for hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance
* **Random Forest** emerged as the best model with **~78.8% accuracy and strong weighted F1-score**
* Evaluated model performance using **accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix and feature importance analysis**
